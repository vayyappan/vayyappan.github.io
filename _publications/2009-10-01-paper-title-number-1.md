excerpt: 'Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, enabling cancer cells to rapidly proliferate, survive in harsh microenvironments, invade, metastasize, and resist treatment. This study determined for the first time that the metabolic enzyme ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase 1 (CKMT1), which reversibly converts creatine (Cr) to phosphocreatine (PCr) in the mitochondrial membrane, is downregulated in breast cancer metastases compared to primary breast tumors. Our findings show that CKMT1 is a key metabolic enzyme that drives cellular Cr and PCr concentrations and activates glycolysis in breast cancer cells. Our data demonstrate that upregulation of CKMT1 reduces breast cancer metastasis by decreasing adhesion, migration, and invasion. CKMT1 holds promise as potential diagnostic marker, prognostic indicator, and treatment target whose expression can be monitored using magnetic resonance spectroscopy-detected Cr and PCr levels.'
