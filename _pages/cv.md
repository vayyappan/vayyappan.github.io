Education
======
* B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 2020 (expected)

Research
======
* Undergraduate Research Assistant, Glunde Lab (September 2016 – present)
  * PROJECT 1: Leading an independent study that interrogates the role of mitochondrial enzyme CKMT1 on cancer cells’ creatine metabolite profile and functional characteristics (e.g. survival, metastatic potential). 
  * PROJECT 2: Screening metabolic enzymes involved in cancer cells’ glutamate metabolite profile.
  * PROJECT 3: Conducted qRT-PCR, western blots, ran NMR scans for a study of the role of choline metabolite genes GDPD5 and GDPD6 in breast cancer
* Research Intern, Haussler Lab, University of California, Santa Cruz	 (June 2015 – January 2016)
 * PROJECT 1: Compiled and curated a database of twelve pediatric cancer studies comprising eleven cancers, 696 patients, 39,623 positional mutations (SNVs and indels), and 46,868 copy number alterations. This database is available online via the UC Santa Cruz Xena Cancer Browser. 
 * PROJECT 2: Gathered RNA sequence data regarding CD8+ cells and natural killer cells and, using R, conducted statistical tests to determine proof-of-concept for a tool that predicts methods of immunosuppression in tumors. 

Engineering and Design
======
* Operations Research Consultant, Johns Hopkins University Scheduling Group	(January 2019 – present)
  * Applying binary integer programming to develop schedules for Minor League Baseball leagues.
* Lead Curator—ADPriboDB, Johns Hopkins University (January 2018 – present)
  * Compiling and curating a dataset of ADP-ribosylated proteins available via the public ADPriboDB database. 
* Design Team Engineer, Johns Hopkins University  (March 2017 – May 2018)
  * Member of a design team working to develop an in-line device to detect blockages in cerebral shunts for hydrocephalus treatment. 
  * Developing CAD models of device components and computational models of fluid flow through shunt valves, conducting bench tests, interviewing neuroradiologists and surgeons regarding the diagnostic/surgical workflow.
* Design Team Engineer, Johns Hopkins University (November 2016 – September 2017)
  * Member of a team of biomedical engineering undergraduates working to develop a low-cost, reusable core-needle biopsy device to facilitate access to breast-cancer diagnosis in the developing world. 
  * Developed CAD models of device components, conducted bench tests, and wrote business plans.
  * Interviewed physicians, nurses, and hospital infection control specialists from the US, India, and South Africa.
  * Stage 2 Funding Awardee, VentureWell E-Team Program, 2nd-place, Social Enterprise Division, 2017 Johns Hopkins University Business Plan Competition, Regional Finalist, 2017 Princeton TigerLaunch Competition
* Design Team Engineer, Engineering World Health (JHU) (September 2016 – May 2017)
  * Member of a team of biomedical engineering undergraduates working toward developing a water sanitation device for developing countries. 
  * Conducted materials-testing/prototyping and wrote business plans.
  * Finalist, Social Enterprise Division, 2017 Johns Hopkins University Business Plan Competition
