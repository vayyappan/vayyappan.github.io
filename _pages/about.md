I am a rising senior at the Johns Hopkins University studying biomedical engineering. My interests are ever-changing, but I'm especially interested in using artificial intelligence to accomplish various tasks in biomedicine, from facilitating basic sciences research to improving the acuity of disease diagnosis and prognostic prediction. 

My non-academic interests include running, bouldering, reading a juicy murder mystery or privately drafting cyberpunk artwork.

Feel free to contact me!
